# Data Analysis of covid19 data
The COVID-19 Deaths Data Analysis Repository is a comprehensive project that aims to analyze and gain insights from a dataset containing information on COVID-19 related fatalities. Leveraging various data analysis tools and techniques, the repository provides an in-depth dataset exploration.

Key Components:

Data Collection: The repository includes the raw COVID-19 deaths dataset, sourced from reputable health organizations and governmental institutions, providing accurate and up-to-date information on COVID-19 fatalities.

Data Cleaning with Pandas: Utilizing Python's powerful library, Pandas, the dataset is thoroughly cleaned and preprocessed. Missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies are handled to ensure the dataset's integrity and reliability for further analysis.

Data Exploration with SQL: Leveraging SQL (Structured Query Language), the repository employs a comprehensive set of queries to explore the dataset further. SQL queries enable the retrieval and aggregation of specific subsets of data, facilitating a deeper understanding of key insights and relationships within the dataset.

Data Visualization with Tableau: Tableau, a leading data visualization tool, is utilized to create interactive and visually appealing representations of the analyzed data. Through a wide array of graphs, charts, and maps, the repository visually communicates trends, patterns, and geographic variations in COVID-19 deaths, making the findings easily understandable to a broader audience.

Statistical Analysis: The repository incorporates statistical techniques to extract meaningful insights, such as mortality rates, fatality trends over time, and demographic breakdowns of COVID-19 victims.

In-Depth Reports: The project includes detailed reports documenting the entire data analysis process, from data cleaning and exploration to visualization and key findings. These reports serve as a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding the methodologies and outcomes of the analysis.
